# Code Refactor Starter Code
In this challenge, the CSS code needs to be cleaned up and notated. The HTML code needs a few adjustments, and accessibility standards to be met. 


## Adjust the CSS Code
------------------------
*   Definitely want to leave some comments behind!
*   Check that CSS rules follow a logical structure.
*   Check rules that share the same attributes and consolidate.
*   Adjust any corresponding HTML descriptors.


## Adjust the HTML Code
-------------------------
*   The title element needs a descriptive title.
*   Check that heading attributes fall in sequential order.
*   Check that HTML elements follow a logical structure.
*   Images need accessible alt attributes and meet accessability standards.


## The Result
---------------
After refactoring the code, the deployed website will be completely functional. Please see the following screenshot and link to the updated webpage:
